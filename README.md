Some projects to check out:

[Darkness Kiss bow](https://github.com/Flamesword33/Created-pictures/blob/main/Darkness%20Kiss%20bow/Darkness%20Kiss1.png):
Hand drawn from reference images for a player. This is the second time since grade school
I have attempted to freehand draw. I think it turned out.

[Kanagaia](https://github.com/Flamesword33/Created-pictures/blob/main/Kanagaia/Kanagaia_attempt_2.jpg):
A mashup image and my current limits at photo editing. It was a deap sea god I needed 
to cook up for a session of D&D.

[Lion color correction](https://github.com/Flamesword33/Created-pictures/blob/main/Lion%20color%20correction/lion%20color%20corrections.jpg):
Like Kellin Foster, this is a re-color project and in this case the original was pure black.

[Sword in the stone](https://github.com/Flamesword33/Created-pictures/blob/main/sword%20in%20stone/SwordInStone.jpg):
A stitch job from various in game screen shots. It needs a few pixel corrections but I was 
able to seamlessly remove the game character and UI.
