Some projects to check out:

Darkness Kiss bow:
Hand drawn from reference images for a player. This is the second time since grade school
I have attempted to freehand draw. I think it turned out.

Kanagaia:
A mashup image and my current limits at photo editing. It was a deap sea god I needed 
to cook up for a session of D&D.

Lion color correction:
Like Kellin Foster, this is a re-color project and in this case the original was pure black.

Sword in the stone:
A stitch job from various in game screen shots. It needs a few pixel corrections but I was 
able to seamlessly remove the game character and UI.
